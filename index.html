          <h3><u>ORION Project</u></h3>
          <h4><i>2321 - 2491</i></h4>
          <p>The first "super-soldier" program of the United Earth Government and
            the United Nations Space Command. The ORION Project was an Office of Naval Intelligence
            and Colonial Military Authority super-soldier program aimed at security
            and counter-insurgency operations. It was originally launched in the
            23rd century, but was deemed too cost ineffective. A later relaunch
            occurred during the Insurrection. Though effective, it eventually
            met a similar fate to the original program. ORION Project participants
            retroactively called Spartans, a phrase coined for the Spartan II
            pogram Director Dr. Catherine Halsey. The ORION Project subjects were
            volunteer adults serving in the Marines or special forces of other branches.
            The use of consenting adults for Spartan programs would not occur again
            until the SPARTAN-IV Program.

          <h3><u>SPARTAN-II Program</u></h3>
          <h4><i>2517 - Present</i></h4>
          <p>Originally designated as ORION Project Generation II, what became the SPARTAN Program
            was a reboot by Dr. Catherine Halsey of the efforts to form a contingent
            of super-soldiers for use in the increasingly unstable Outer Colonies.
            Kept classified from all but the highest levels of the UNSC and ONI brass;
            the program's "recruits" were children five and six years of ages who
            were kidnapped, replaced with clones that rapidly deteriorated, and were
            trained, underwent extensive and dangerous mechanical and biological augmentation,
            and coupled their enhanced physiology with the recently developed MJOLNIR
            powered combat exoskeletons. SPARTAN-II's were instrumental in during the
            Human-Covenant War and those surviors still in service are considered
            the superior model to all other Spartan variants. In 2547, during the Human-Covenant
            War the program was made public to boost morale but the details of how
            SPARTAN-II's were created remained highly secret.

          <h3><u>SPARTAN-III Program</u></h3>
          <h4><i>2531 - 2553</i></h4>
          <p>While SPARTAN-II's were very successful and huge force multipliers they
            were also ruinously expensive. The cost of a single SPARTAN-II was equivalentt
            to the cost of an entire naval battlegroup. In the desperate times of the Human-Covenant
            War ONI authorized Colonel James Ackerson to begin a new program which could
            create super-soldiers more cheaply and in greater numbers. SPARTAN-III's were
            also the product of kidnapping, extensive training, and some biological and mechnical
            enhancement but the latter were far less extensive. In addition, they were equipped
            not with MJOLNIR armor (a unit of which was similar in cost to an entire cruiser)
             but instead Semi-Powered Infiltration armor (SPI) which was stealthier
             but offered far less protection and increased abilities to their users.
             The SPARTAN-III Program was increadibly deadly with entire companies often
             suffering 100% casualty rates. ONI deployed SPARTAN-III companies on suicide
             missions to buy time during the war until hopefuly more SPARTAN-II's could
             be produced.

          <h3><u>SPARTAN-IV Program</u></h3>
          <h4><i>2553 - Present</i></h4>
          <p>Returning to a program made up of volunteer military personnel, <thead>
            SPARTAN-IV program seeks to strike a moral balance and, frankly, to
            make super-soldiers more affordable and more plentiful than the SPARTAN-II
            program while attaining similar results. This is done by using advances in safer,
            but less effective, biological and mechanical augmentation and to make up
            the difference in physical abilities with more advanced, second generation,
            armor. SPARTAN-IV's were integrated with and serve alongside those
            SPARTAN-II's and SPARTAN-III's willing to continue serving.
